  abstract      = { The high cost of the US health care system does not buy uniformly high quality of care. Concern about low quality has prompted two major types of public policy responses: regulation, a top-down approach, and report cards, a bottom-up approach. Each can result in either functional provider responses, which increase quality, or dysfunctional responses, which may lower quality. What do we know about the impacts of these two policy approaches to quality? To answer this question, we review the extant literature on regulation and report cards. We find evidence of both functional and dysfunctional effects. In addition, we identify the areas in which additional research would most likely be valuable. },

Conventionally, solutions to such problems originate from the health care sector, a conception reinforced by the dominant biomedical imagination of health. By contrast, attention to the social determinants of health has recently been given new force in the fight against health inequity. The health care sector is a vital determinant of health in itself and a key resource in improving health in an equitable manner. Actors in the health care sector must recognize and reverse the sector's propensity to generate health inequity. The sector must also strengthen its role in working with other sectors of government to act collectively on the deep-rooted causes of poor and inequitable health. },
